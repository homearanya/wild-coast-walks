The Amphitheatre is the most recognisable and dramatically imposing feature of the Northern Drakensberg mountain range. A World Heritage Site of outstanding environmental and cultural significance which rises over 1000 metres from the Tugela Valley to the Lesotho plateau nearly 3000 metres above sea level. The Tugela Falls, the world's second tallest falls (and the highest in Africa), plunges 948m over the basalt face of the Amphitheatre, down to Royal Natal National Park below.

The **Amphitheatre Slackpacking Trail** has been designed to enable walkers of average fitness to reach the summit and be rewarded by these never-to-be-forgotten views: a feat normally only undertaken by very fit and experienced hikers who would normally have to camp overnight in tents or caves.

By spending 3 days and 3 nights on the route, staying at conveniently located lodges along the way and accompanied by an experienced trail guide, it is possible for anyone who is reasonably fit and unafraid of heights, to stand on "top of the world" and experience the same sense of accomplishment as the hardened hiker.

On this trail, you'll do between 25-30 kilometres over 3 days of hiking with a total ascent of nearly 1200m. The views along the way though will be worth every drop of sweat!
